I feel that I understand more about how to declare and use ArrayLists and user-defined objects from the project. 
I wrote several methods, including the Binary Search and testWord ones, which search the data file for words
and test to see if the word guessed is possible with the user's hand. Some challenges that I experienced was some issues with the Scanner and some issues with figuring out how to decide if the user can make a certain word. There were some Scanner errors that I experienced that were resolved by removing extra scnr.close() statements. I made a function that would be able to decide if a user can make a word with his hand by using several for loops to iterate through the characters in the string and the characters that the user has. It counts the lettesr and decides if there is too little characters to create the user's word. Some challenges in group communication were that some members did not respond to the email I sent out to decide when to meet. The group met with those who did respond.
